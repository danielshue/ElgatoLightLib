# Elgato Lights

The ElgatoKeyLight library is a C# library specifically designed for controlling Elgato Lights. 

Elgato Lights are programmable LED lights that can be used for various purposes, such as lighting setups for streaming, video production, or general ambiance lighting.

This library provides a set of functions and classes that allow you to interact with and control Elgato Lights programmatically. 
With this library, you can adjust the brightness, color temperature, and other settings of the lights, as well as turn them on or off.

To use the ElgatoKeyLight library in your C# project, you will need to add a reference to the library and import the 
necessary namespaces. Once you have done that, you can create instances of the ElgatoKeyLight class and use its methods 
to control the lights.

It's worth noting that in order to use this library, you will need to have the necessary hardware, such 
as an Elgato Key Light or Key Light Air, and the Elgato Control Center software installed on your computer.

If you have any specific questions or need help with a particular aspect of using the ElgatoKeyLight library, feel free to ask!
